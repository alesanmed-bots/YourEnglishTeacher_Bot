## Bot description
This a bot for learning new english vocabulary. When you send the bot the `/start` command, you'll be automatically registered. Each day, you'll receive a new word with its definition, use examples and an audio for knowing how to pronounce it.

## Bot usage
To start using the bot just [talk to it](https://telegram.me/YourEnglishTeacher_bot). The bot commands are the following:

* `/start` Registers you in the bot and make the bot send you a new word each day.
* `/suggest [word]` Suggests a word for being added to the bot. The suggestions are revised by admins and they decide if the word suggested is added or not.
* `/about` Shows a message with some info about the bot, the developer who created it and how to contact him.
* `/help` Shows a message with all the commands available for you.
